## Overview
A mood tracker application that allows users input a rating of their mood on a scale of 1-10, and a note about their current mood. 
This will end up being a complete CRUD app so users can create, read, update, and delete their moods. 
They will also be able to see a list of all of their moods and sort by date or rating.
